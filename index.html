          CrossComm,<br>
          Thank you for considering me as a new member of your team and extending me the opportunity to share more about myself.
          <br>
          <br>
          My background consists of fine art, graphic design and web development. As a designer I have over a decade of experience that includes work in the print industry, non-profit sector and public education as a design teacher. As a lifelong artist, I am most passionate about being a part of processes that tell unique stories through creating exquisite designs and applications that truly speak to clients needs. Originally, I am a self taught developer who began experimenting with basic markup and styling languages. As the times changed, so did the need to deepen my knowledge of programming which led me to The Iron Yard’s coding bootcamp. As a designer I naturally flourished in front end languages and frameworks, however, I continue to learn as many languages I can in order to be an effective, well rounded developer.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am attracted to CrossComm’s accomplishments and know from experience that working with a small team requires a collaborative and “all hands on deck” approach. I believe my diverse skill set and professional background would be as asset to your team and culture. I also believe I can learn immensely from the wealth of experience your team currently has.
          <br>
          <br>
          You will find links to my design work and code (for this application and others) in the navigation bar.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thank you again for your time and opportunity.
          <br>
          <br>
